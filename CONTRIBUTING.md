# 🤝 Contributing – Business Metrics Data Dictionary

This project was built to organize and standardize common business metrics across functions like Sales, Finance, Product, and Marketing. It serves as both a quick reference and a foundation for future metric alignment and analytics work.

## 💡 What You Can Contribute

I’d love feedback or contributions in areas such as:

- Additional metric definitions (especially across domains)
- Suggested improvements to formula clarity or benchmark sources
- Better categorization of metrics (e.g., grouping by funnel stage or role)
- Tooling ideas for turning this into an app, API, or data catalog

---

## 📦 Tech Stack (Planning Stage)

The current version is based on Excel, but future iterations may include:
- CSV / JSON export
- Python + Streamlit or Flask API
- SQL query templates for metrics
- AI-based metric suggestion system
